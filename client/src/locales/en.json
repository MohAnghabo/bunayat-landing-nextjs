      {
        "question": "How quickly can we start generating invoices?",
        "answer": "Most landlords generate their first Arabic invoice within 30 minutes. We import your Excel tenant list, verify municipal formatting, and you can create compliant invoices same-day."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do tenants need to download an app for payments?",
        "answer": "No. Tenants receive SMS and email notifications with invoice details. They confirm payments via bank transfer using their mobile number - the same method they use for other bills. You track confirmations in Bunayat."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Arabic language support really complete?",
        "answer": "Yes. All invoices, contracts, and official documents generate in proper Arabic formatting that meets municipality requirements. Our Omani customers submit these for audits without modifications."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does payment tracking work?",
        "answer": "Tenants pay via bank transfer and confirm payment through SMS or email. You mark payments as received in Bunayat, which automatically stops reminder sequences. Payment gateway integration is available for Enterprise plans."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can we export data for our accountant?",
        "answer": "Everything exports to Excel with Omani accounting standards. Invoices, payment confirmations, tenant records - your accountant gets familiar formats without learning new software."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of support do you provide?",
        "answer": "Arabic and English support via email, chat, and phone. Local team understands Omani regulations and municipal compliance requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data secure and compliant with Omani regulations?",
        "answer": "Enterprise-grade security with 256-bit SSL encryption. Complies with Omani data protection regulations and municipal audit requirements."
